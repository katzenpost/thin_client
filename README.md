# thin client library for Katzenpost client daemon

A thin client library is designed to talk to the katzenpost mixnet client daemon.
It's kind of like a dumb terminal, it doesn't know how to do much besides
message passing. All the hard work is done by the client daemon.

Here's the client2 daemon source code:
https://github.com/katzenpost/katzenpost/tree/main/client2

That directory has a Makefile which will give you two ways to build the daemon:

1. Makefile target "warpedclientdaemon": build binary for use with docker test mixnet.
2. Makefile target "clientdaemon": build binary for production mixnet.

We recommend that you look over the client2.toml configuration file generated by
our dockerized test mixnet. Using that configuration file you can either make
the daemon listen for thin client connections on a TCP/IP socket or you can
specify a UNIX domain socket.

### Compatibility

This git repo contains two implementations of the thin client for katzenpost mixnet.
One of them is written in Python and the other is written in Rust. Both use async io.

Works with Katzenpost v0.0.40 or later.


## Rust

**thin client library for Rust**

*This thin client has full feature parity with the golang reference thin client.*

**compile rust crate as usual**

```bash
cargo build

```


## Python

**thin client library for Python**

Currently the python implementation only supports using UNIX domain sockets.

**install**

```bash
pip instal -e .
```
