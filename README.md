# thin client library for Katzenpost client daemon


**thin client library for python**

Works with Katzenpost v0.0.40 or later.

A thin client library is designed to talk to the katzenpost mixnet client daemon.
It's kind of like a dumb terminal, it doesn't know how to do much.
The client daemon does all the hard work.


## install

```bash
pip instal -e .
```
